# Lodestone-guide-thing
Just to help with installing lodestone on forge 1.18.2 40.2.0

alright so first make sure that your forge is 1.18.2 40.2.0
if it's not i suggest upgrading or downgrading to it!

first go to the build.properties and add the things from the build.properties in this github just to help make things simple for you
