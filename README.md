# Lodestone-guide-thing
Just to help with installing lodestone on forge 1.18.2 40.2.0

alright so first make sure that your forge is 1.18.2 40.2.0
if it's not i suggest upgrading or downgrading to it!

first go to the build.properties and add the things from the build.properties in this github just to help make things simple for you 
and then just go to build.gradle and add the things in the repositories to your repos same with dependencies.

just dont delete things in your current files the files in this github only contain the things you need to add :P

dm me if you have issues as i just kinda threw this together :D
